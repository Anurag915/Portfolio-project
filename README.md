Web Development Portfolio of Anurag Prajapati
This website is my web development portfolio where I showcase my web development skills and projects.
I created this website as a way to demonstrate my web development abilities and to attract potential clients or employers.

My website features a simple and elegant design that highlights my web development work. 
It has a navigation menu that allows the user to easily access different sections of the website, such as the home page, the about page, the services page, the work page, and the contact page.
It also has a footer that contains my social media links and a newsletter subscription form.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the main web technologies  to create my website.
I used GitHub Pages to host and deploy my website and GitHub to manage my project repository.

I have worked on several web development projects for different clients and purposes.

Designing and implementing a landing page for a new mobile app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Developing and deploying a portfolio website for a graphic designer using HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages

Through this website, I have learned a lot about web development, web design, and web hosting. 
I have also improved my web development skills and technologies. I am always eager to learn new things and to take on new challenges in web development.

This website is still a work in progress and I plan to add more features and functionalities to it in the future. Some of the possible improvements are:

Adding more web development projects to my portfolio
Incorporating more user feedback and personalization to my website
Enhancing the websiteâ€™s performance and security
Evaluating the websiteâ€™s usability and user satisfaction
